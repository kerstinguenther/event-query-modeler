# OS Integration

## Directly open `.bpmn` files with the app

> Currently this is possible on Mac OS X only due chrome limitations

To open `.bpmn` files with the app, do the following:

* Open Chrome
* Navigate to `chrome://flags/#enable-apps-file-associations`
* Click __Enable__ on the Apps file associations tab
* Restart Chrome

Now double clicking a `.bpmn` file on your computer should automatically launch the bpmn.io application.
